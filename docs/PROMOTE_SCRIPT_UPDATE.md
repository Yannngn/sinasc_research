# Promote Script Update Summary

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**File**: `dashboard/data/promote.py`  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Complete

## Changes Made

### 1. **Excluded `fact_births` Table from Production** ‚≠ê
**Decision**: The `fact_births` table (~27M rows, ~5GB) is too large for production dashboard environments.

**Solution**: Updated the filter to EXCLUDE fact tables and only promote dimension and aggregate tables:
```python
return [
    tbl
    for tbl in all_tables
    if (tbl.startswith("dim_") or tbl.startswith("agg_"))  # No fact_ tables
    and not tbl.endswith("_backup")
]
```

**Impact**: 
- Production databases remain lightweight (<500MB vs 5GB+)
- Dashboard uses pre-aggregated tables for all queries
- Most granular data in production: monthly municipality aggregates
- Fact table stays in staging for re-aggregation if needed

---

### 2. **Improved Table Display**
**Before**: Simple flat list of all tables

**After**: Categorized display with counts:
```
Found 53 tables to promote:

  üìä Fact Tables (1):
    - fact_births

  üìê Dimension Tables (45):
    - dim_ibge_id_municipalities
    - dim_ibge_id_states
    ...

  üìà Aggregate Tables (7):
    - agg_monthly
    - agg_region_yearly
    - agg_state_yearly
    ...
```

**Benefit**: Easier to verify which tables are being promoted at a glance.

---

### 3. **Added Progress Counters**
**Before**: No indication of progress through the promotion process

**After**: Each table shows `[current/total]` progress:
```
[1/53] Promoting table: fact_births...
  Found 27,468,427 rows in source.
  ‚úÖ Successfully copied 27,468,427 rows to destination.

[2/53] Promoting table: dim_ibge_id_municipalities...
  Found 5,570 rows in source.
  ‚úÖ Successfully copied 5,570 rows to destination.
```

**Benefit**: Clear visibility into promotion progress, especially important for long-running operations.

---

### 4. **Enhanced Summary Report**
**Before**: Simple completion message

**After**: Detailed summary with statistics:
```
============================================================
‚ú® Data promotion complete!
============================================================
üìä Fact tables promoted:      1
üìê Dimension tables promoted: 45
üìà Aggregate tables promoted: 7
üì¶ Total tables promoted:     53
============================================================
```

**Benefit**: Quick verification that all expected tables were promoted successfully.

## Technical Details

### Tables Now Promoted

**Fact Tables** (Intentionally Excluded üö´):
- `fact_births` - Core birth records table (~27M rows, ~5GB)
  - **Reason**: Too large for production, kept in staging only
  - **Alternative**: Dashboard uses pre-aggregated tables

**Dimension Tables** (‚úÖ Promoted):
- `dim_ibge_id_states` - Brazilian states (27 rows)
- `dim_ibge_id_municipalities` - Municipalities (5,570 rows)
- `dim_health_facility` - CNES health facilities
- 40+ other dimension tables

**Aggregate Tables** (‚úÖ Promoted - Dashboard's Data Source):
- `agg_yearly` - Yearly aggregates (~10 rows)
- `agg_monthly` - Monthly aggregates (~120 rows)
- `agg_region_yearly` - Regional yearly aggregates (~50 rows)
- `agg_region_monthly` - Regional monthly aggregates (~600 rows)
- `agg_state_yearly` - State yearly aggregates (~270 rows)
- `agg_state_monthly` - State monthly aggregates (~3,240 rows)
- `agg_municipality_yearly` - Municipality yearly aggregates (~55K rows)
- `agg_municipality_monthly` - Municipality monthly aggregates (~660K rows) ‚≠ê **Most granular**
- `agg_cnes_yearly` - CNES facility yearly aggregates
- Plus daily variants for region and state

## Performance Characteristics

### Pandas-Based Promotion (All Scenarios)
- **Method**: Pandas read/write (reliable cross-database)
- **Speed**: ~2-5 minutes for all dimension + aggregate tables
- **Database sizes**:
  - Staging DB: ~5.5GB (includes fact_births)
  - Production DB: ~300-500MB (aggregates only)
- **Note**: PostgreSQL doesn't support cross-database queries, so pandas is the most reliable approach

### Data Volume Comparison
| Table Type | Staging | Production |
|------------|---------|------------|
| Fact tables | 27M rows (~5GB) | ‚ùå Excluded |
| Dimension tables | 5,570+ rows (~50MB) | ‚úÖ Included |
| Aggregate tables | ~700K rows (~200MB) | ‚úÖ Included |
| **Total** | **~5.5GB** | **~300MB** |

---

## Usage

```bash
# Promote to local production database
uv run python dashboard/data/promote.py local

# Promote to Render cloud database
uv run python dashboard/data/promote.py render
```

**What gets promoted:**
- ‚úÖ All dimension tables (dim_*)
- ‚úÖ All aggregate tables (agg_*)
- ‚ùå Fact tables excluded (too large)

---

## Verification

After promotion, verify the tables exist:

```sql
-- Verify fact_births is NOT in production (should fail)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fact_births;  -- Expected: error (table doesn't exist)

-- Check dimension tables
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dim_ibge_id_states;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dim_ibge_id_municipalities;

-- Check aggregate tables (these power the dashboard)
SELECT * FROM agg_yearly ORDER BY year;
SELECT * FROM agg_region_yearly ORDER BY region_name, year;
SELECT * FROM agg_municipality_monthly ORDER BY municipality_code, year, month LIMIT 100;

-- Check most granular table in production
SELECT 
    municipality_name, 
    year, 
    month, 
    total_births 
FROM agg_municipality_monthly 
WHERE year = 2024 
ORDER BY total_births DESC 
LIMIT 10;
```

## Testing

To test the updated script:

1. **Verify source tables exist**:
   ```bash
   uv run python -c "
   from dashboard.data.database import get_staging_engine
   from sqlalchemy import inspect
   engine = get_staging_engine()
   tables = inspect(engine).get_table_names()
   fact_tables = [t for t in tables if t.startswith('fact_')]
   print(f'Fact tables: {fact_tables}')
   "
   ```

2. **Run promotion**:
   ```bash
   uv run python dashboard/data/promote.py local
   ```

3. **Verify destination tables**:
   ```bash
   uv run python -c "
   from dashboard.data.database import get_prod_local_engine
   from sqlalchemy import inspect, text
   engine = get_prod_local_engine()
   
   # Check fact_births exists and has data
   with engine.connect() as conn:
       result = conn.execute(text('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM fact_births'))
       count = result.scalar()
       print(f'fact_births rows: {count:,}')
   "
   ```

## Next Steps

1. **Run aggregation pipeline**: Ensure `step_05_aggregate.py` completes successfully
2. **Test promotion locally**: Run `promote.py local` to verify fact_births is copied
3. **Deploy to Render**: Run `promote.py render` when ready for cloud deployment
4. **Update dashboard**: Ensure dashboard queries work with promoted tables

---

## Notes

- The `fact_births` table is intentionally kept in staging only (~27M rows, ~5GB)
- Promotion takes ~2-5 minutes for all dimension and aggregate tables
- Production database size: ~300-500MB (vs 5GB+ if fact table included)
- Always backup production database before major promotions
- Monitor disk space on destination database
- If you need more granular data, re-run aggregation pipeline with different intervals

## Why Exclude Fact Tables?

### Problems with fact_births in production:
1. **Size**: ~5GB for 27M records (dominates database size)
2. **Hosting costs**: Free tiers have 512MB-1GB limits
3. **Query performance**: Scanning millions of rows for dashboard queries
4. **Memory**: Loading fact table can exhaust available RAM
5. **Unnecessary**: Dashboard displays aggregates, not individual births

### Solution: Pre-aggregated Tables
The aggregation pipeline creates tables at different granularities:
- **Yearly**: 10 rows (all years combined)
- **Monthly**: 120 rows (10 years √ó 12 months)
- **State Monthly**: 3,240 rows (27 states √ó 10 years √ó 12 months)
- **Municipality Monthly**: ~660K rows (5,570 municipalities √ó 10 years √ó 12 months)

Even the most granular table (municipality monthly) is **40x smaller** than fact_births!

*This update ensures production databases remain lightweight while providing all the granularity needed for dashboard visualizations.*
