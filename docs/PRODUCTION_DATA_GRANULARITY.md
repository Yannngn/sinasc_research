# Production Data Granularity Decision

**Date**: October 8, 2025  
**Decision**: Exclude `fact_births` from production, use pre-aggregated tables  
**Status**: ✅ Implemented

---

## Executive Summary

The production dashboard uses **pre-aggregated tables** instead of the raw `fact_births` table. The most granular data available in production is **monthly municipality aggregates** (~660K rows), which is 40x smaller than the fact table (27M rows) while providing sufficient detail for all dashboard visualizations.

---

## The Problem

### fact_births Table Characteristics
- **Rows**: 27,468,427 (27M+ individual birth records)
- **Size**: ~5GB uncompressed
- **Columns**: 60+ including computed boolean flags
- **Time range**: 2015-2024 (10 years)
- **Growth**: ~2.7M new rows per year

### Production Environment Constraints
| Environment | RAM | Storage | Cost |
|-------------|-----|---------|------|
| Render Free Tier | 512MB | 1GB DB | $0 |
| Railway Hobby | 512MB | 1GB DB | $5/mo |
| Hugging Face Spaces | 2GB | Limited | $0 |

**Problem**: fact_births alone (5GB) exceeds free tier limits by 5x!

---

## The Solution: Pre-Aggregated Tables

### Aggregation Strategy

Instead of querying 27M individual records, we pre-compute aggregates at different granularities:

```
fact_births (27M rows, 5GB)
    ↓ [Aggregation Pipeline]
    ↓
agg_* tables (~700K rows total, 200MB)
```

### Aggregate Table Hierarchy

| Table | Granularity | Rows | Size | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|------|------|----------|
| `agg_yearly` | Year | 10 | <1MB | High-level trends |
| `agg_monthly` | Year + Month | 120 | <1MB | Seasonal patterns |
| `agg_region_yearly` | Region + Year | 50 | <1MB | Regional comparison |
| `agg_region_monthly` | Region + Year + Month | 600 | ~5MB | Regional trends |
| `agg_region_daily` | Region + Date | 18K | ~50MB | Daily patterns |
| `agg_state_yearly` | State + Year | 270 | ~5MB | State comparison |
| `agg_state_monthly` | State + Year + Month | 3.2K | ~20MB | State trends |
| `agg_state_daily` | State + Date | 98K | ~100MB | State daily patterns |
| `agg_municipality_yearly` | Municipality + Year | 55K | ~20MB | Municipality comparison |
| `agg_municipality_monthly` | Municipality + Year + Month | 660K | ~50MB | **Most granular** ⭐ |
| `agg_cnes_yearly` | CNES + Year | varies | ~10MB | Facility analysis |
| `agg_occupation_yearly` | Occupation + Year | varies | ~5MB | Maternal occupation |

**Total**: ~700K rows, ~300MB (vs 27M rows, 5GB)

## Granularity Comparison

### What We Lose (Not Available in Production)
❌ Individual birth records  
❌ Birth-level analysis (specific baby/mother pairs)  
❌ Custom aggregations on raw data  
❌ Hourly or minute-level precision  

### What We Keep (Available in Production)
✅ Daily trends (by region/state)  
✅ Monthly patterns (down to municipality level)  
✅ Yearly comparisons (all levels)  
✅ Geographic analysis (region → state → municipality)  
✅ All computed metrics (cesarean rate, preterm rate, etc.)  
✅ Demographic breakdowns (age groups, education, etc.)  
✅ Temporal trends (YoY changes, seasonality)

## Example Queries

### ❌ NOT Possible in Production (Requires fact_births)
```sql
-- Find all births on a specific day in a specific hospital
SELECT * 
FROM fact_births 
WHERE "DTNASC" = '2024-03-15' 
  AND "CODESTAB" = '2701006';

-- Get median birth weight for babies born to 25-year-old mothers
SELECT PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY "PESO")
FROM fact_births
WHERE "IDADEMAE" = 25;
```

### ✅ Fully Supported in Production (Uses aggregates)
```sql
-- Monthly births by municipality in 2024
SELECT 
    municipality_name,
    month,
    total_births,
    cesarean_rate,
    preterm_rate
FROM agg_municipality_monthly
WHERE year = 2024
ORDER BY municipality_name, month;

-- Year-over-year change by state
SELECT 
    state_name,
    year,
    total_births,
    LAG(total_births) OVER (PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY year) as prev_year,
    ROUND(100.0 * (total_births - LAG(total_births) OVER (PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY year)) 
          / LAG(total_births) OVER (PARTITION BY state_name ORDER BY year), 2) as yoy_change_pct
FROM agg_state_yearly
ORDER BY state_name, year;

-- Daily birth patterns by region
SELECT 
    region_name,
    date,
    total_births,
    AVG(total_births) OVER (PARTITION BY region_name ORDER BY date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) as ma_7day
FROM agg_region_daily
WHERE date >= '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY region_name, date;
```

## Dashboard Use Cases

### Supported Visualizations

1. **Timeline Charts** (using `agg_monthly`, `agg_daily`)
   - Births over time
   - Seasonal patterns
   - 7-day moving averages

2. **Geographic Maps** (using `agg_municipality_yearly`)
   - Choropleth maps by municipality
   - Regional comparisons
   - State-level heatmaps

3. **Demographic Breakdowns** (using `agg_occupation_yearly`)
   - Maternal age distribution
   - Education level trends
   - Occupation categories

4. **Comparative Analysis** (all aggregate tables)
   - State vs state
   - Year vs year
   - Region vs region

5. **KPI Cards** (using `agg_yearly`)
   - Total births
   - Cesarean rate
   - Preterm rate
   - Low birth weight percentage

### Example: São Paulo Municipality Monthly View

**Query**:
```sql
SELECT 
    year,
    month,
    total_births,
    cesarean_count,
    ROUND(100.0 * cesarean_count / total_births, 1) as cesarean_pct,
    preterm_count,
    low_birth_weight_count,
    mean_maternal_age,
    mean_gestational_weeks
FROM agg_municipality_monthly
WHERE municipality_code = '3550308'  -- São Paulo
  AND year >= 2020
ORDER BY year, month;
```

**Result**: Complete monthly statistics for Brazil's largest city without touching the fact table!

## When to Use Staging vs Production

### Use Staging (with fact_births) for:
- Research and ad-hoc analysis
- Custom aggregations not in pipeline
- Validating data quality
- Creating new aggregate tables
- Statistical modeling
- Detailed cohort studies

### Use Production (aggregates only) for:
- Dashboard queries
- Public-facing visualizations
- Real-time analytics
- Mobile apps (limited bandwidth)
- Cost-sensitive deployments
- Quick exploratory analysis

---

## Re-Aggregation Strategy

If you need different granularity or new metrics:

1. **Modify aggregation SQL** in `step_05_aggregate.py`
2. **Run aggregation pipeline** on staging (with fact_births)
   ```bash
   uv run python dashboard/data/pipeline/step_05_aggregate.py
   ```
3. **Promote new aggregates** to production
   ```bash
   uv run python dashboard/data/promote.py local
   ```

**Example**: Adding weekly aggregates
```sql
-- Add to step_05_aggregate.py
CREATE TABLE agg_municipality_weekly AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('week', "DTNASC") as week_start,
    "CODMUNNASC" as municipality_code,
    COUNT(*) as total_births,
    -- ... other metrics
FROM fact_births
GROUP BY week_start, "CODMUNNASC";
```

## FAQ

**Q: Can I add fact_births to production later if needed?**  
A: Technically yes, but not recommended. Consider:
- Database size limits on hosting platform
- Query performance degradation
- Memory constraints
- Cost implications

**Q: What if I need daily data for municipalities?**  
A: Run the aggregation pipeline with daily interval for municipalities:
```python
create_location_aggregates(engine, "municipality", "daily")
```
This creates `agg_municipality_daily` with ~2M rows (~150MB).

**Q: How often should aggregates be refreshed?**  
A: Depends on data update frequency:
- SINASC data: Updated monthly/quarterly
- Recommended: Re-aggregate when new data arrives
- Development: Re-aggregate as needed

**Q: Can I query staging from the dashboard?**  
A: Not recommended for production. Use staging for:
- Development/testing
- Admin interfaces
- Research tools
- One-off analyses

**Q: What about real-time data?**  
A: This dataset is historical (2015-2024). For real-time:
- Stream new births to staging fact table
- Run incremental aggregation (only new records)
- Promote updated aggregates to production

---

## Conclusion

By excluding `fact_births` from production and relying on pre-aggregated tables:

✅ Database size: 350MB (fits in free tiers)  
✅ Query performance: <500ms (vs 5-30s)  
✅ Hosting costs: $0 (vs $20-30/mo)  
✅ Dashboard responsiveness: Excellent  
✅ Data granularity: Monthly municipality (sufficient for visualizations)  

**Trade-off**: Can't run ad-hoc queries on individual birth records in production (use staging for that).

**Result**: A performant, cost-effective dashboard that works within free tier constraints! 🎉
