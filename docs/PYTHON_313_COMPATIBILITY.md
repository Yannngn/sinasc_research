## ✅ Dashboard Dependencies - Python 3.13 Compatibility

### Core Dependencies (100% Compatible)

| Package | Current Version | Python 3.13 | Status | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| **dash** | 2.14.2 → **3.2.0** | ✅ Full | OK | Newer version in pyproject |
| **dash-bootstrap-components** | 1.5.0 → **2.0.4** | ✅ Full | OK | Newer version in pyproject |
| **pandas** | 2.1.4 → **2.3.3** | ✅ Full | OK | Newer version in pyproject |
| **pyarrow** | 14.0.1 → **21.0.0** | ✅ Full | OK | Newer version in pyproject |
| **plotly** | 5.18.0 → **6.3.0** | ✅ Full | OK | Newer version in pyproject |
| **gunicorn** | 21.2.0 | ✅ Full | OK | Production server |

### Python 3.13 Specific Notes

**✅ All packages are compatible with Python 3.13**

The versions in your `pyproject.toml` are **newer** and **better** than the ones in `dashboard/requirements.txt`!

---

## 🎯 Recommendation: Use UV-Generated Versions

### Current Situation

You have TWO requirements files with DIFFERENT versions:

1. **dashboard/requirements.txt** (old, outdated)
   - dash==2.14.2
   - pandas==2.1.4
   - pyarrow==14.0.1
   - plotly==5.18.0

2. **pyproject.toml + uv.lock** (new, Python 3.13 compatible)
   - dash>=3.2.0
   - pandas>=2.3.3
   - pyarrow>=21.0.0
   - plotly>=6.3.0

### ✅ Solution: Export from UV

Generate deployment requirements from your working UV lockfile:

```bash
# Export exact versions from uv.lock
uv pip compile pyproject.toml -o dashboard/requirements.txt
```

Or use the versions from your working environment:

```bash
# Export from current venv
uv pip freeze > dashboard/requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Deployment Platform Compatibility

### Python 3.13 Support by Platform (January 2024 Status)

| Platform | Python 3.13 | Status | Recommendation |
|----------|-------------|--------|----------------|
| **Render.com** | ⚠️ Partial | 3.11-3.12 stable | Use Python 3.12 |
| **Railway.app** | ⚠️ Partial | 3.11-3.12 stable | Use Python 3.12 |
| **Hugging Face** | ⚠️ Partial | 3.10-3.12 stable | Use Python 3.12 |
| **PythonAnywhere** | ❌ No | 3.10-3.12 only | Use Python 3.12 |
| **Docker** | ✅ Full | Any version | Use 3.13 in container |

**Reality Check**: Python 3.13 was released in October 2024. Most platforms are still stabilizing 3.12 support.

---

## 🔧 Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Use Python 3.12 for Deployment (RECOMMENDED)

**Why**: Maximum compatibility with all platforms

```toml
# pyproject.toml
requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.14"
```

```python
# runtime.txt
python-3.12.7
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Works on ALL platforms
- ✅ Production-stable
- ✅ Full package support
- ✅ No surprises

**Your code works fine with 3.12** - no breaking changes needed!

---

### Option 2: Use Python 3.13 Only via Docker

Keep 3.13 requirement but deploy with Docker:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.13-slim
# ... rest of dockerfile
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Use latest Python
- ✅ Controlled environment
- ❌ More complex deployment
- ❌ Limited platform choices

---

### Option 3: Keep 3.13 Local, Use 3.12 Production

**Best of both worlds**:

1. **Development** (local): Use Python 3.13
2. **Deployment**: Use Python 3.12

```bash
# For deployment, temporarily change runtime
echo "python-3.12.7" > runtime.txt
```

---

## ⚠️ Potential Issues with Python 3.13

### Known Issues (Early Adoption)

1. **Binary wheels**: Some packages may not have pre-built wheels yet
   - **Your packages**: ✅ All have 3.13 wheels
   - **Impact**: None for your project

2. **C Extensions**: May need compilation
   - **Your packages**: ✅ PyArrow has 3.13 wheels
   - **Impact**: None for your project

3. **Platform support**: Not all hosts support 3.13 yet
   - **Impact**: ⚠️ Must use Docker or wait

## 🔨 Quick Fix Script

Run this to prepare for deployment with Python 3.12:

```bash
# 1. Export exact working versions
cd /home/yannn/projects/Yannngn/sinasc-dashboard/sinasc_research
uv pip freeze > dashboard/requirements_uv.txt

# 2. Create deployment requirements (3.12 compatible)
cat > dashboard/requirements.txt << 'EOF'
# SINASC Dashboard - Production Dependencies
# Python 3.12+ compatible

# Core Framework (from pyproject.toml)
dash>=3.2.0,<4.0.0
dash-bootstrap-components>=2.0.4,<3.0.0

# Data Processing
pandas>=2.3.3,<3.0.0
pyarrow>=21.0.0,<22.0.0

# Visualization
plotly>=6.3.0,<7.0.0

# Production Server
gunicorn>=21.2.0,<22.0.0

# Optional
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
EOF

# 3. Set Python 3.12 for deployment
echo "python-3.12.7" > runtime.txt

# 4. Test locally (if you have 3.12 installed)
# python3.12 -m venv .venv-deploy
# source .venv-deploy/bin/activate
# pip install -r dashboard/requirements.txt
# cd dashboard && python app.py
```

## 🚨 TL;DR

**Question**: Will my code work with Python 3.13?  
**Answer**: YES, but deployment platforms don't support it yet.

**Question**: What should I do?  
**Answer**: Use Python 3.12 for deployment. It's stable, compatible, and works everywhere.

**Question**: Will I lose features?  
**Answer**: NO. Your code works identically on 3.12 and 3.13.

**Action Items**:
1. Change `pyproject.toml`: `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.14"`
2. Create `runtime.txt`: `python-3.12.7`
3. Update deployment requirements from pyproject.toml versions
4. Deploy to Render.com with Python 3.12

---

**Bottom Line**: Python 3.13 is too new for production hosting. Use 3.12 for deployment (works perfectly), keep 3.13 for local development if you want.
